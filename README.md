# Fun data science projects with Python
## Author: Hoang Van Phan

Welcome to the repository of my data science side projects! I used statistical analysis and machine learning tools to address some real-life problems, such as predicting the lottery winning numbers, coming up with a winning stock trading strategy, and understanding the housing bubble in Australia.

List of projects:
* [Lottery numbers](https://github.com/hoangvanphan/fun_projects/blob/master/vietlott/analyze_winning_numbers.ipynb): I attempted to find any patterns to the jackpot winning numbers of a Vietnamese lottery. In the end, the winning numbers were truly random, so I couldn't cheat the system.
* [Stock trading strategy](https://github.com/hoangvanphan/fun_projects/blob/master/trading_strategy/stock_trading.ipynb): I implemented a simple stock trading strategy, analyze its effectiveness and improve upon it. My strategy could not beat the buy-and-hold strategy, however.
* [Stock price forecasting](https://github.com/hoangvanphan/fun_projects/blob/master/stock_forecast/stock_forecast.ipynb): I attempted to predict stock price with ARIMA model and some simple machine learning models. I found that I could not accurately predict stock prices.
* [Understanding the Australian house prices](https://github.com/hoangvanphan/fun_projects/blob/master/AU_house_price/AUS_house_price.ipynb): I used linear regression to model the house prices in Australia using various factors such as population, inflation rate and the central bank interest rate. I found that population had the strongest effect, and stock market performance the weakest effect, on the rising house prices in Australia after controlling for other variables.
