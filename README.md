# Fun data science projects with Python
## Author: Hoang Van Phan

Welcome to my repository!

You will find here some projects that I came up with. I have had fun doing them, I hope that the types of analysis I perform are practical in other applications.

Current projects:
* [Analysis of lottery numbers](https://github.com/hoangvanphan/fun_projects/blob/master/vietlott/analyze_winning_numbers.ipynb): I attempt to find any patterns to the jackpot winning numbers of a Vietnamese lottery.
