# Fun data science projects with Python
## Author: Hoang Van Phan

Welcome to my repository!

You will find here some projects that I came up with. I have had fun doing them, I hope that the types of analysis I performed are practical in other applications.

List of projects:
* [Lottery numbers](https://github.com/hoangvanphan/fun_projects/blob/master/vietlott/analyze_winning_numbers.ipynb): I attempt to find any patterns to the jackpot winning numbers of a Vietnamese lottery.
* [Stock trading strategy](https://github.com/hoangvanphan/fun_projects/blob/master/trading_strategy/stock_trading.ipynb): I implement a simple stock trading trategy, analyze its effectiveness and improve upon it.
* Stock price forecasting: the classic project of predicting stock price. I will try to predict stock price with machine learning, using information that I think would be relevant.
